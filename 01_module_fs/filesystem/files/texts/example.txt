According to legend, the ancient Roman statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields when news arrived that the Aequi, 
Romeâ€™s powerful enemy to the east, had invaded. Rome was in need of swift, decisive action, and the senate had chosen 
him to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow, took control 
and, in a matter of weeks, saved Rome.
